through a service is one of the easiest ways 
to make money like editing videos or one-to-one coaching but these are limited they're capped 
because it requires you to trade time for money so it's hard to scale there's only one of you 
so a productized service then is turning that service into a product and you're automating 
the process so that you can eventually take yourself out of the equation and that income can 
be made passive so for example one of my friends is a personal trainer and she used to before the 
pandemic do one-to-one classes and charged by the hour then she built it into a product High service 
so she offers subscribers 30 workouts per month for 18 per month and she has about 4 000 people 
that are subscribed and she's making monthly income from that so she has ultimately made a 
package service she's built an app she started a subscription service and hired a team of people 
so she spent a lot of time building this up which is why I'll give this a four in terms of getting 
started it's not easy but now she has other people that have stepped in and run the day-to-day so 
other personal trainers who record the workouts and upload them or the marketing and she basically 
oversees it all but it requires the skill set to be able to get there and make sure that value 
is consistently being provided which isn't simple to do and so even on the maintenance Side 
and being able to consistently make money from this I would give this a four out of five so those 
are some passive income streams to give you some ideas if you have done any of these already I'm 
curious to know what your experience was will there and if you'd recommend it yourself or if 
you have other passive income streams that have really worked for you I'd love to hear about 
it if you did enjoy this video you may also enjoy another video that I have and I'll link 
it up here and there on things that I no longer buy even though I have built up my passive 
income streams and I hope to see
