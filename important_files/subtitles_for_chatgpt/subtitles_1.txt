you would need to invest fifty thousand dollars of your own money but because these REITs generally have long leases where the Brew chip tenants the rental income you can make is relatively more reliable in various market conditions number two is being a Creator printer this is being a content creator but I've called it createdpreneur to emphasize that to make this a passive income stream you need to think about content creation as an entrepreneur and this is a middle ground that isn't really tapped into so on one side you can love creating content but if you don't think of it as a business it's just a hobby whereas if you solely focus on the business side of it you're going to burn out before even making it into a passive income Stream So you want to tie both of these together for a platform like YouTube in terms of getting started anyone could do it you literally need a phone and an internet connection so I'm going to give this a one to get started the harder part and what makes this into a passive income stream is actually how long you can keep this up for without seeing the returns and this is where the entrepreneurial side comes in setting up the process hiring Outsourcing so that you can concentrate on producing quality content for as long as possible it took 10 months of making no money through YouTube for me to finally be eligible for the partnership program and now I make hundreds of the day from YouTube AdSense and most of that is passive because it's coming through my older videos another example is Ali who last year made 405 million from YouTube and he spends a couple of hours a week on it he also has a YouTube course on how he's built this up and the systems he's put around it are link it below if you are considering it and want to check it out but the hardest part of this income stream is putting in the time and staying consistent so I'm going to give this a four in terms of Maintenance but if you can get through that initial phase you can make a lot
