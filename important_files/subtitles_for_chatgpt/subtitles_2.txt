of money through YouTube and this is one of the best passive income streams in my opinion number three an online course I'm a big fan of this one because firstly as a consumer it gives you so much access to information that you wouldn't otherwise have and from a passive income point of view it's a great place to make scalable income an example of someone who has done really well from this is cat Norton who started a tick tock profile around tricks and tips of using Excel those videos blew up and evolved into her teaching others about Excel through online courses and in her first year from doing this full time she made one million dollars in sales from air and now on a good day she makes over six figures a day from her courses which are completely passive she made it once and now she sells it again and again so how hard is this to get started the real thing or the real difficulty here is to identify what value you can bring and what you can teach to other people that they're willing to pay for once you've got that bit figured out it's about creating the class and putting on a platform like skillshare or udemy which doesn't really require much in terms of Maintenance or you can host it on your own website and make sure you're driving traffic to it so in terms of Maintenance that's the easier part and I'm going to give that a two out of five the fourth way to make passive income and this is the truest form of passive income out there and that is through dividend investing the way to think about this is when you buy a share of a company you now own a little piece of that company and so if it's paying dividends that means they are taking part of their profits and giving you a percentage in terms of getting started I'll give this a three because buying individual stocks for the dividends requires a lot of research if you don't want to be spending a lot of time reading through all the financial statements and the accounts then a better way to make passive income through
