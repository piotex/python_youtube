tips of using Excel those videos blew up and evolved into her teaching 
others about Excel through online courses and in her first year from doing this full time she made 
one million dollars in sales from air and now on a good day she makes over six figures a day from 
her courses which are completely passive she made it once and now she sells it again and again 
so how hard is this to get started the real thing or the real difficulty here is to identify 
what value you can bring and what you can teach to other people that they're willing to pay for 
once you've got that bit figured out it's about creating the class and putting on a platform like 
skillshare or udemy which doesn't really require much in terms of Maintenance or you can host it 
on your own website and make sure you're driving traffic to it so in terms of Maintenance that's 
the easier part and I'm going to give that a two out of five the fourth way to make passive income 
and this is the truest form of passive income out there and that is through dividend investing 
the way to think about this is when you buy a share of a company you now own a little piece 
of that company and so if it's paying dividends that means they are taking part of their profits 
and giving you a percentage in terms of getting started I'll give this a three because buying 
individual stocks for the dividends requires a lot of research if you don't want to be spending 
a lot of time reading through all the financial statements and the accounts then a better way 
to make passive income through dividends is by invest testing in index funds this is the 
path that I take and it's a safer way to earn dividends than only individual stocks because 
you're diversifying what you have exposure to so instead of being focused on one company 
and its dividends you now have pieces of lots of different companies that will pay dividends 
in terms of getting started I'll give this one it's really easy to do set up a brokerage account 
invest in index funds but in terms of Maintenance and making a lot of money through this I'll give 
it a three because although you don't really need to do anything with your Investments if it's 
an index fund to really reap the benefits you do need to keep investing and also reinvest the 
dividends to buy more shares of those index funds and then the real passive income will be through 
the appreciation and the capital gain side of it the fifth way to make passive income is through 
selling digital products so this includes ebooks downloadables presets website themes what I really 
like about digital products is that it takes time to create them but the costs are so low and it's 
pretty much passive thereafter so one example of someone who has done really well from the S is 
Steve shoga who has packaged up all the knowledge he had learned through his day job about design 
tips and bundled it up in an e-book and according to an article online he made a 2
3 million dollars 
from it we all think we have to create something revolutionary to make a lot of money but that idea 
may just come from what we do day to day most of us go to job daily as an expert in our field but 
never think to turn what we know into an ebook and that's exactly what he did in terms of starting 
I'd give this a two you really don't need any money to get started but the harder part again 
is actually coming up with the idea that people will pay for and in terms of Maintenance and being 
able to make money from it I'm going to give this a three out of five because you can either put it 
on sites like Etsy and people can search for it or you could spend more time creating an audience 
and creating content and use that to boost your sales even further but the most important thing 
is being able to provide something valuable that people are willing to pay for the sixth passive 
income method is affiliate marketing so this is when you promote someone else's goods or services 
and get a commission or a small percentage for doing so so for example if you see the links in 
my description those are affiliate links and so I get a percentage of that sale and it doesn't cost 
you any more money for buying that product through the link according to an article online the 
national average amount an affiliate makes is 55 000 per year and for me through that and YouTube 
AdSense combined in the last week I made nineteen thousand dollars so how easy is it anyone can 
sign up and join the affiliate program that
