in this video I'm going to rate seven passive 
income ideas based on firstly how hard it is to get started and secondly how hard it is to 
maintain and make money from it so whether you're working a 95 and want some passive income on the 
side or you're looking to start a side hustle that are two main ways you can do this the first is by 
buying physical property and making money through rental income for this the barriers to entry are 
quite High you need money for a down payment you need a good credit score and then you need to 
Source the property and find a good tenant so in terms of getting started I'd give this a three 
out of five and in terms of Maintenance you can choose how passive you want this to be so if you 
want to manage your properties yourself it will cost you your time or if you want to hire someone 
or give it to a property manager to handle it will cost you money and so if that sounds like a lot 
of work the second way you can make money through rental income without actually needing a deposit 
or managing the property is through investing in a real estate investment trust a Reit is essentially 
a company that invests in different types of properties it could be hotels warehouses shopping 
centers and then it rents those properties out and from the rental income it receives it's 
legally required to pay 90 of that income to its shareholders in the form of dividends so in terms 
of getting started and investing in a read I give this one it's far easier to do and you could buy 
publicly traded REITs through a brokerage account like like you would any other stock and in terms 
of Maintenance and how much you can make I'd give this a two because you do not have the hassle of 
direct ownership but you do need to invest a fair amount of money to make a decent return because 
you're not relying on any leverage so for example segro which is a reach that invests in property 
around Europe is offering a 3
4 return so to be able to make the equivalent of around 140 a month 
you would need to invest fifty thousand dollars of your own money but because these REITs generally 
have long leases where the Brew chip tenants the rental income you can make is relatively more 
reliable in various market conditions number two is being a Creator printer this is being a 
content creator but I've called it createdpreneur to emphasize that to make this a passive income 
stream you need to think about content creation as an entrepreneur and this is a middle ground 
that isn't really tapped into so on one side you can love creating content but if you don't think 
of it as a business it's just a hobby whereas if you solely focus on the business side of it 
you're going to burn out before even making it into a passive income Stream So you want to 
tie both of these together for a platform like YouTube in terms of getting started anyone could 
do it you literally need a phone and an internet connection so I'm going to give this a one to get 
started the harder part and what makes this into a passive income stream is actually how long you can 
keep this up for without seeing the returns and this is where the entrepreneurial side comes in 
setting up the process hiring Outsourcing so that you can concentrate on producing quality content 
for as long as possible it took 10 months of making no money through YouTube for me to finally 
be eligible for the partnership program and now I make hundreds of the day from YouTube AdSense 
and most of that is passive because it's coming through my older videos another example is Ali 
who last year made 405 million from YouTube and he spends a couple of hours a week on it he also 
has a YouTube course on how he's built this up and the systems he's put around it are link it below 
if you are considering it and want to check it out but the hardest part of this income stream is 
putting in the time and staying consistent so I'm going to give this a four in terms of Maintenance 
but if you can get through that initial phase you can make a lot of money through YouTube and this 
is one of the best passive income streams in my opinion number three an online course I'm a big 
fan of this one because firstly as a consumer it gives you so much access to information that you 
wouldn't otherwise have and from a passive income point of view it's a great place to make scalable 
income an example of someone who has done really well from this is cat Norton who started a tick 
tock profile around tricks and
