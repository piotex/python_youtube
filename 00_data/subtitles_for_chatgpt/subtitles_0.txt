in this video I'm going to rate seven passive income ideas based on firstly how hard it is to get started and secondly how hard it is to maintain and make money from it so whether you're working a 95 and want some passive income on the side or you're looking to start a side hustle that are two main ways you can do this the first is by buying physical property and making money through rental income for this the barriers to entry are quite High you need money for a down payment you need a good credit score and then you need to Source the property and find a good tenant so in terms of getting started I'd give this a three out of five and in terms of Maintenance you can choose how passive you want this to be so if you want to manage your properties yourself it will cost you your time or if you want to hire someone or give it to a property manager to handle it will cost you money and so if that sounds like a lot of work the second way you can make money through rental income without actually needing a deposit or managing the property is through investing in a real estate investment trust a Reit is essentially a company that invests in different types of properties it could be hotels warehouses shopping centers and then it rents those properties out and from the rental income it receives it's legally required to pay 90 of that income to its shareholders in the form of dividends so in terms of getting started and investing in a read I give this one it's far easier to do and you could buy publicly traded REITs through a brokerage account like like you would any other stock and in terms of Maintenance and how much you can make I'd give this a two because you do not have the hassle of direct ownership but you do need to invest a fair amount of money to make a decent return because you're not relying on any leverage so for example segro which is a reach that invests in property around Europe is offering a 3
4 return so to be able to make the equivalent of around 140 a month
