but the hard part here is actually driving traffic so whilst I say I made x amount in a week actually it took me a year to build a platform and build an audience to get me in a place where I can make that passively and so the affiliate side is almost a byproduct of the amount of work that you'd put in to grow that audience in the first place and so to really scale and make this passive you do need a lot of traffic so you can put it on your social media website your blog your Twitter and the amount you make from it is really dependent on how much you're putting it up front to grow those Avenues so with that said in terms of Maintenance I'm going to give it a four because it is a lot of work to keep that traffic coming through organically finally idea number seven of this passive income stream video is productized service this is a hybrid between a product and a service making money through a service is one of the easiest ways to make money like editing videos or one-to-one coaching but these are limited they're capped because it requires you to trade time for money so it's hard to scale there's only one of you so a productized service then is turning that service into a product and you're automating the process so that you can eventually take yourself out of the equation and that income can be made passive so for example one of my friends is a personal trainer and she used to before the pandemic do one-to-one classes and charged by the hour then she built it into a product High service so she offers subscribers 30 workouts per month for 18 per month and she has about 4 000 people that are subscribed and she's making monthly income from that so she has ultimately made a package service she's built an app she started a subscription service and hired a team of people so she spent a lot of time building this up which is why I'll give this a four in terms of getting started it's not easy but now she has other people that have stepped in and run the day-to-day so other personal trainers who record the workouts and upload them or the marketing and she basically oversees it all but it requires the skill set to be able to get there and make sure that value is consistently being provided which isn't simple to do and so even on the maintenance Side and being able to consistently make money from this I would give this a four out of five so those are some passive income streams to give you some ideas if you have done any of these already I'm curious to know what your experience was will there and if you'd recommend it yourself or if you have other passive income streams that have really worked for you I'd love to hear about it if you did enjoy this video you may also enjoy another video that I have and I'll link it up here and there on things that I no longer buy even though I have built up my passive income streams and I hope to see you there
